FMOD:
	According to FMOD, you can actually redistribute the required files more or less. Needs a bit more clarification but here's what I got.
	"We allow people to redistribute our dll, just not the whole contents of the FMOD SDK installer. If you can dynamically link to FMOD’s dll you should be able to distribute it and not have to include any other files."
	
FBX:
	http://help.autodesk.com/view/FBX/2019/ENU/?guid=FBX_Developer_Help_welcome_to_the_fbx_sdk_technical_support_html
	https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3.0/
	tl;dr I can use it just have to credit them and say if I've made changes! (Which ofc I haven't.)
	
	
PERSONAL TODO:
	- Need more FMod clarification, says you can't use it in game engine but they mentioned otherwise earlier. Perhaps I was misunderstood.
	- FBX was probably not added to SDK list because it's a large file, that's about it(?)
