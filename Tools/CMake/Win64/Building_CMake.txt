Preparation:
	## Install CMake
	https://github.com/Kitware/CMake/releases/download/v3.13.3/cmake-3.13.3-win64-x64.msi

	## Download Windows-source
	https://github.com/Kitware/CMake/releases/download/v3.13.3/cmake-3.13.3.zip

	## Install QT SDK for CMake-GUI (Takes ~50GB's):
		https://www.qt.io/download
		Select QT 5.12.0
	
		Installs more than you need, can select specific generators/etc. if you want.
	
Building:
	## Generate solution, make sure you have the preload file (below) in your source root.
	cmake . -Wno-dev -B"solutions_cmake/win64"

	## Install exe's, end up in 'standalone' directory. Either via CLI or VStudio.
		CLI: cd solutions_cmake/win64 && cmake . --target install --config Release
		VStudio: Build "CMakePredefinedTargets/INSTALL"
		
Deployment:
	Copy over the 3 directories here & run setup.bat.
	This to setup QT dll's needed for cmake-gui to work, into the same folder as the exe.
